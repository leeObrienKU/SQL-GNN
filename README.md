Project Title:  From Tables to Graphs: Evaluating GNN Performance in SQL-Integrated Systems

Overview: 
SQL databases are widely used for storing and managing structured data due to their efficiency, reliability, and well-established querying capabilities. However, they face inherent limitations when dealing with complex, interconnected relationships such as those found in social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection models. Representing such data within a relational framework often requires multiple joins and recursive queries, which can lead to performance bottlenecks.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a powerful alternative for analyzing relational data, capturing intricate dependencies, and improving predictive modeling. Despite their advantages, the direct integration of GNNs with SQL databases has been largely unexplored. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a framework that enhances SQL databases with GNN capabilities. By doing so, organizations can leverage advanced graph-based learning without fully transitioning to specialized graph databases. This integration holds potential for improving analytics, optimizing SQL query performance, and enhancing decision-making in data-driven applications.
The project will be structured according to the following key milestones:
•	Project Registration Form Submission: 17th February 2025
•	Individual Project Definition & Research Proposal: 17th April 2025
•	Formative Viva/Presentations: During the week of 7th July 2025
•	Dissertation Submission: 18th September 2025
•	Final Demonstration/Presentation: Between 18th September and 2nd October 2025
Furthermore, the study will utilise publicly available datasets to construct and evaluate the proposed framework. Since the research does not involve sensitive or personally identifiable information, formal ethical approval from the university will not be required. Data sources will be selected based on their accessibility, relevance, and compliance with open data policies to ensure ethical integrity in research.

Aims and Objectives: 
The primary goal of this research is to design and evaluate a methodology for integrating GNNs with SQL databases, enabling seamless transformation of relational data into graph structures. Specifically, the study will:
•	Investigate the limitations of SQL databases in handling graph-like data and explore efficient data extraction and transformation techniques.
•	Implement and compare different GNN architectures to assess their performance on graph data derived from SQL-based storage.
•	Optimize the process of converting structured SQL data into graph representations while minimizing computational overhead.
•	Benchmark the performance of SQL-integrated GNN systems against traditional graph databases in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
•	Explore potential applications, such as enhancing SQL query optimization and improving analytical models in domains where relational and graph-based insights are essential.
By addressing these objectives, this research seeks to contribute a novel framework that balances the robustness of SQL databases with the analytical power of GNNs, ensuring both efficiency and scalability for real-world applications.
